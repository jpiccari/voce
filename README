Project Description
-------------------

voce is an interactive IRC robot that is meant to be helpful to the users in a
chat room. The project aims to be a sturdy platform on which to build telephony
switching features that interface with IRC. Specifically interfacing FreeSWITCH
features like conference management, announcements, and call routing.


Status
------

The project is posted here mostly for historical reasons. The code is stale and
very infrequently updated, however it is very stable and is a great starting
point for someone looking to develop an IRC robot, or as an example of how to
interact with FreeSWTICH from a remote program via BSD sockets. Again, this
project is no longer maintain as it has served its purpose as an educational
experience and as an experiment with VoIP and SSL technologies.


Compiling and Installation
--------------------------

The source should be able to compile on various BSDs (including OS X) or Linux
with a simple `make` command. This will produce an executable named 'voce' which
can be placed anyway you like and run. It does provide some help and usage info
but not much. For a full understanding of the configuration file format, or list
of command line switches read through the source, it is all there in multicolor.
